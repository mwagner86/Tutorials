we will create a library.
To create a static library called liblprprint.a containing this function, just type the following two command lines in your GNU shell:
gcc -c lpr_print.c
ar rs liblprprint.a lpr_print.o
The -c option to gcc produces only a .o object code file, without linking it, while the ar command (with its rs options) permits the creation of an archive file,
which can contain a bundle of other files that can be re-extracted later (for example,
when executing library code). In this case, we are only archiving one object code file, but in some cases, you might want to archive multiple ones. (See the man page for ar for more information.)

To create a shared library called liblprprint.so instead, enter the following sequence of commands:
gcc -c -fpic lpr_print.c
gcc -shared -o liblprprint.so lpr_print.o
(For the record, pic stands for "position-independent code", an object-code format required for shared libraries. You might need to use the option -fPIC instead of -fpic if your library is very large.)
